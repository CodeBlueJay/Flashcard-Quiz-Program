# Flashcard-Quiz-Program
## Authors: Jayden Ratanatharathorn, Ahmad Yahia, Owen Yim

**Problem:** Studying vocabulary or facts gets boring (Or just studying in general), and some people may not get much value out of just staring at terms and definitions.

**Application Description:** Our program will be a studying-based application where the user inputs terms they would like to memorize, and answers they need to memorize that correspond with each term. The program will have different options when it comes to the method of studying, similar to Quizlet, Anki, and other flashcard-based study websites, potentially including games, matching, and randomized tests on each of the flashcards.
